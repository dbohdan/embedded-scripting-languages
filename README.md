# Contributing

Your contributions are welcome! Please submit a pull request or create an issue to add a new language to the list. I am looking for language implementations that are either actively maintained or largely "done". The VM and the standard library, if any, must have a free (*libre*), non-copyleft or limited-scope copyleft license (e.g., the GNU LGPL or the MPL, but not the GNU GPL). If the main bytecode compiler is a separate program, it must have a license that doesn't automatically apply to its output. Optional add-ons may have any license: from strong copyleft to proprietary. A Datalog implementation must be able to parse Datalog source code; it must not be just an EDSL.
